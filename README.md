# odin_recipes
Try to create  a webpage of recipes. Last lesson of Odin Project in HTML section from foundations course.
I will try to create a webpage of recipes using only HTML for now, and then I will modify it using CSS and Java. 
I am taking inspiration from this websites: https://www.buonissimo.it/ ; https://www.allrecipes.com/ ; https://www.simplyrecipes.com/ .
